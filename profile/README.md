# Aquafall [OS]  
  
Welcome to Aquafall, a web operating system inspired by ArcOS.    
  
## Why does Aquafall exist?  
  
Aquafall was created to fill the gap of [ArcOS](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS), as they recently announced their shutdown.

## So, what is Aquafall?
  
It's just like ArcOS, a web operating system made in Svelte, however we use JavaScript instead of TypeScript. This is not a rebrand of ArcOS.  

## Is Aquafall compatible with ArcOS?  
  
If people want the APIs to be ArcOS-Compatible and Aquafall to be compatible with ArcAPIs, we can try to implement this.

## I want to contact you.

You can shoot me an email at [AquafallOS@outlook.com](mailto:aquafallos@outlook.com), and I'll do my best to reply.
